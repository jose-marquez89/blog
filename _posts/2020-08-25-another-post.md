This is one for the record books folks! The newest acer computer is running 
ruby and is serving this jekyll site! I had to transplant the hard drive from my old mac straight into this old thing. Surprisinly, it's handing the task _exceedingly_ well! Needless to say, I'm VERY impressed...

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight python %}
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, color):
        self.name = name
        self.color = color

    def bark(self):
        print(f"{self.name} barked!")
{% endhighlight %}
