<p>As a recent graduate of what some refer to as a coding bootcamp
(I’m leaving comments on the <a href="https://lambdaschool.com/">Lambda School</a>
experience for another post), I have a vested interest in understanding the
current state of hiring affairs. If you’ve stumbled across this blog post from the
future, I would confidently assume your familiarity with COVID-19
and its impact on everything from mundane errands to the most
salient political matters. With the restrictions imposed by the virus on social
proximity, hiring for jobs that would normally require an in-person interview
saw a dramatic change almost overnight. When I began my foray into Lambda
School’s Data Science program, I was advised to set my sights <em>away</em> from remote
employment opportunities; with the advent of COVID-19, remote
work has become the norm, albeit begrudgingly. The need for employees
to stay home led to some companies carrying out layoffs, while
others made plans to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/retailwire/2020/08/18/rei-sells-its-headquarters-others-should-take-notice/#2c8589f13166">sell their headquarters</a>.
With these impacts in mind, I sought to investigate the current state of hiring in
the tech sector, resorting to <a href="https://www.indeed.com/">Indeed</a>
for some current insights into the tech hiring status.</p>

<h3 id="remote-work">Remote Work</h3>

<p>With a quick search for your respective tech job role on Indeed,
you can see a number of details about the jobs you seek, including
a ‘Remote’ flag on each job card when the job poster wants to
explicitly mark the job with that opportunity. I used that marker
to help identify jobs that could offer remote positions, although
it’s entirely possible that some jobs could be temporarily remote
for the time being. The great majority of postings (more than 80%)
were not marked as remote in general, but we <em>can</em> see a marked
shift in the adoption of the ‘Remote’ tag by posts as the weeks go
by.</p>

<figure class="text-center"><!-- Remote Proportion -->

		<!-- figcaption class="figure-caption">Data from indeed.com</figcaption -->
</figure>

<p>As seen in the figure above, the proportion of jobs marked as ‘Remote’
   by companies posting jobs on Indeed steadily rose from below 13%
   to nearly 20% (the spike in the beginning of the plot could be a
   result of a generalization; posts any older than 30 days get marked
   as ‘30+ days old’, so the true rate of change is likely hidden in
	 that discrepancy). At the time of this post, it’s unclear whether
	 this rise will continue. For now, it's a safe assumption that a job
   applied to in 2020 could be remote. Depending on the role, a job may have a higher propensity to be listed
   as a remote opportunity. As illustrated in the visualization below, Digital Marketing
   Managers and UX Designers appear to enjoy more demand as remote positions,
   while companies hiring Systems Engineers and Administrators likely require
   employees to carry out more hands on tasks, as suggested by the lower proportion
   of remote opportunities.</p>

<h4>Pay</h4>

<p>Although not necessarily related to the hiring climate, I wanted to take a look
   at salary ranges for the most in-demand tech roles. Where applicable, I compiled
   salary floors and ceilings to try and find the average lows and highs for each
   job category. In the following bar chart, we can see a potential reason for
   aspiring applicants to gravitate towards the coveted Data Scientist role; with
   an average salary floor of around 100 thousand per year and a ceiling well in
   excess of 120 thousand per year, the title holds first place in the realm of
   salary potential. When looking at the figure below, it's may be important to
	 note that "Software Developer" often described some form of Web Developer position.
	 Although there are no clear reasons for this generalization, the varied role
	 that some developers play in the tech industry could make it challenging for
	 some many non-technical recruiters to define the job to a higher level of specificity.</p>
